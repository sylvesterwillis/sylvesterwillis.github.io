I have recently been accepted into the Georgia Tech Online Masters program and have been eager to start the related coursework to obtain the degree. Coincidentally, there happens to be a challenge for the month of December at [http://devember.org/](http://devember.org/) which involves spending at least one hour per day programming or learning about programming. 

The concept of spending a small amount of free time learning about programming sounds appealing to me since it will provide a reason for me to get a head start on my future coursework.
