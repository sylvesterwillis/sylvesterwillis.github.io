I have recently been accepted into the Georgia Tech Online Masters program and have been eager to start the related coursework to obtain the degree. Coincidentally, there happens to be a challenge for the month of December at [http://devember.org/](http://devember.org/) which involves spending at least one hour per day programming or learning about programming. The concept of spending a small amount of free time learning about programming sounds appealing to me since it will provide a reason for me to get a head start on my future coursework. I also plan to spend some time learning Go, and will most likely seek to grab a copy of the Go Programming book and read through it as well.

Of course, Devember isn't the only coding challenge in town, there are plenty that seek to motivate people to learn programming or do some programming throughout the month of December. Some of these include: 
    - [24 Pull Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/) which aims to encourage contributions to open source projects and can provide a list of projects which need help based upon the languages that you are interested in working with.
    - [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) wants to help students across the world learn programming and has a great search feature that will allow you to find a school near you if you're interested in teaching.
