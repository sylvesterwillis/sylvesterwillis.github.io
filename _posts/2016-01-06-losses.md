I recently had a bad game in the process of playing Malphite, and I wanted to write out my feelings about losing and having a bad game. Usually, when I have a bad game I tend to attempt to avoid League for the days aftwerwards, and this is a behavior that I would like to remove using CBT, so let's talk about bad games and losing. Having a bad game and losing makes me feel much worse than having a bad game and winning.

Using a hypothetical player, let's say that this player has played 5000 games of League with a 52% win rate. In the course of these games, this player has won 2600 games and lost 2400. Assuming that our hypothetical players games follows a bell curve, we can assume that the player will have a majority of "average" games, with some bad games and good games depending on the players skill level. Due to this, the goal of someone who wants to get better is to have a graph similar to ![Ideal Game Curve](/assets/img/PlayerBellCurve.png)

Even then, there will always be games that are bad due to the amount of games that are played. The goal of improving as a player is to have the lowest amount of bad games possible, since if you perform well, you increase the chances of your team winning by at least 20%, perhaps even more if you can also help your teammates do well. As long as you keep the focus on learning and improving as a player, then losses and bad games should be thought of as games where you get a ton of learning, in that sense, bad games can be some of the best games that you can play. 

Also, if even someone as good as TiP Rush can have a bad game, then so can we.
