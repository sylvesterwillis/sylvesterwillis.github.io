Recently I have been interested in learning the Go programming language, and decided to buy the Go programming book which is written by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. Brian Kernighan is one of the authors of The C Programming Language and a renowned computer scientist and Alan Donovan is an engineer at Google who has been working on the Go team since 2012. Having these two as authors provide a good mix of programming language analysis as well as examples that will carry over well to any projects that you may be considering using Go for.

The book starts off with an explanation of the languages beginnings and what features from other languages it includes. My favorite part of this section is the flowchart that shows a sort of "family tree" with ALGOL 60 being the matriarch of sorts with Go being at the bottom. Another discussion of note is that Golang's implementation of channels is derived from a paper written by Tony Hoare in 1978. The authors then go on to provide information about the philosophy of Go, explaining why they chose to include certain features and not others. The big takeaway from this is that Go as a language provides a small set of features with a very extensive library that can be used however you see fit. This simplicity can be seen throughout the entire book when working through the examples within.
